# ZSearch
Cool project I thought of. Thought to test the hyper-optimized nature of Zig to the fullest.

# Notes
Writing out a psuedo-code version in JS because I have never used JS and it looked funny.

Zig need time to work on, which I don't have.

# Stats  03/02/2023
Database entry size: 593k (always scrapin') 121MB

Search Engine Response Time Avg: 885ms

# Issues
Zig-sqlite can go die in a hole :<

Not enough braincells remaining to get it to work.

Always come back and try again tho.

# Todo:

Write it in zig :duh:

Severly optimize the searching and tf-idf functions

Possibly build JS to an exe?
